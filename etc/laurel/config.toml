# "array" (the default) causes EXECVE a0, a1, a2 â€¦ arguments to be
# output as a list of strings, "ARGV". This is the default, it allows
# analysts to reliably reproduce what was executed.
#
# "string" causes arguments to be concatenated into a single string,
# separated by space characters, "ARGV_STR". This form allows for
# easier grepping, but it is impossible to tell if space characters in
# the resulting string are a separator or were part of an individual
# argument in the original command line.
