# NAME
laurel(8) -- transform, enrich Linux audit logs

# SYNOPSIS

`laurel` is an `auditd(8)` plug-in that parses Linux audit events,
enriches them with local information, and transforms them into a
JSONlines-based output format intended for consumption by log
processing and SIEM software.

# OPTIONS
**-c FILE**, **-\-config=FILE**
: path to configuration file (default: unset)

**-d**, **-\-dry-run**
: Only parse configuration and exit

**-h**, **-\-help**
: Print short help text and exit

**-v**, **-\-version**
: Print version and exit

# DESCRIPTION

`laurel` is typically configured to be spawned by `auditd(8)` itself or by
`audispd(8)` (for 2.x _auditd_ versions). All audit events are fed to
`laurel` via its standard input channel.

Sample configuration file `/etc/audit/plugins.d/laurel.conf`:
```
active = yes
direction = out
type = always
format = string
path = /usr/sbin/laurel
args = --config /etc/laurel/config.toml
```

An alternative setup consists of an AF_UNIX socket to which
`auditd(8)` writes events. A connection is then established by
`laurel` (see `input` setting below). In this case, the operator is
responsible for starting and restarting `laurel`.

Example configuration file:
```
active = yes
direction = out
path = builtin_af_unix
type = builtin
args = 0600 /var/run/laurel.sock
format = string
```

# CONFIGURATION

Configuration of `laurel` itself is done through a single
configuration file in TOML format.

## main section

This section contains basic operation parameters.

- `user`: `laurel` is started as `root` by `auditd`, but it drops to
  a dedicated user as soon as possible. Default: unset
- `directory`: The base directory into which all files are written.
  Default: `.` (current directory)
- `statusreport-period`: How often stats are written to Syslog, in
  seconds. Default: unset
- `input`: `laurel` can consume audit events from standard input or
  connect to a listening socket specified as `unix:/path/to/socket` at
  start. Defaulkt: `stdin`
- `marker`: A string that is written to the log on startup and
  whenever `laurel` writes a status report. Default: none

<!-- `user` and `directory` are unset by default for debugging -->

## `[auditlog]` section

This section describes the main audit log file. `laurel` performs its
own log file rotation, just like `auditd(8)`.

- `file`: Filename for the audit log file. Default: `audit.log`
- `size`: Size in bytes after which the log file is rotated. Default:
  10MiB
- `generations`: Number of generations to keep after rotation.
  Default: 5
- `read-users`: List of users that are granted read access
  to the log file using POSIX ACLs. Default: empty
- `line-prefix`: A string that is prepended to every line. Default:
  unset

## `[filterlog]` section

This section describes the log file for filtered-out log events (see
below). The `file`, `size`, `generations`, `read-users`, `line-prefix`
configuration items work just like for the audit log.

## `[transform]` section

- `execve-argv`: The list of `EXECVE.a*` fields are transformed to an
  `ARGV` list or `ARGV_STR` string. Set to `array`, `string` (or
  both). Default: `array`
- `execve-argv-limit-bytes`: Arguments are cut out of the middle long
   argument lists in `EXECVE.ARGV` or `EXECVE.ARGV_STR` so that this
   limit is not exceeded. Default: unset

## `[translate]` section

Options that can be configured here correspond to what `auditd(8)`
does when configured with `log_format=ENRICHED`.

- `userdb`: Add translations for `uid` and `gid` fields. Default: false
- `universal`: Add translations for everything else: `SYSCALL.arch`,
  `SYSCALL.syscall`, `SOCKADDR.saddr`
- `drop-raw`: Drop raw (numeric) syscall, arch, UID, GID values if
  they are translated. Default: false

## `[enrich]` section

Options that can be configured here actually add information to events

- `execve-env`: A list of environment variables to dump for `exec`
  events. Default: `["LD_PRELOAD", "LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]`
- `container`: Add container information for processes running within
  container runtimes. Default: true
- `pid`: Add context information for process IDs. Default: true
- `script`: If an `exec` syscall spawns a script (as opposed to a
  binary), add a `SCRIPT` entry to the `SYSCALL` record. A script is
  assumed if the first `PATH` entry does not correspond to file
  mentioned  in `SYSCALL.exe`. Default: true
- `user-groups`: Add groups that the user ("uid") is a member of.
  Default: true

## `[label-process]` section

Labels can be attached to processes and are added to any event
associated with those processes. These labels can be propagated from
parent to child processes.

- `label-exe.<regexp> = <label-name>`: Regular expressions/label
  mappings applied to binary executables (`SYSCALL.exe`) on `exec`
  calls. Default: none
- `label-script.<regexp> = <label-name>`: Regular expressions/label
  mappings applied to scripts (`SYSCALL.SCRIPT`, see `enrich.script`
  description above) on `exec` calls. Default: none
- `label-keys`: A list of keys that are applied as a process label,
  see `auditctl(8)`'s `-k` option. Default: none
- `unlabel-exe.<regexp> = <label-name>`: Like `label-exe`, but for
  removing labels
- `unlabel-script.<regexp> = <label-name>`: Like `label-script`, but
  for removing labels
- `propagate-labels`: List of labels that are propagated to child
  processes. Default: empty

## `[filter]` section

Filters make `laurel` drop entire events from the log file while still
using them for internal processing such as process tracking.

- `filter-keys`: A list of strings that are matched against
  `SYSCALL.key` to drop the event. Default: empty
- `filter-null-keys`: Filter events without specified key. Default: false
- `filter-labels`: A list of strings that are matched against process
  labels. Default: empty
- `filter-raw-lines`: A list of regular expression that are matched
  against individual input lines as written by `auditd(8)`. Events
  that contain such lines are then filtered. Default: empty
- `filter-action`: What to do with filtered events? `drop` or `log` to the
  filterlog defined above.
- `keep-first-per-process`: Keep the first event observed for any
  given process even if it would be filtered otherwise. This should
  only be turned off if reproducible process tracking or process tree
  reconstruction is not required. Default: true

# SIGNALS

`SIGHUP` causes `laurel` to process any buffered input and restart. It
can be used to reconfigure `laurel` without having restarting
`auditd(8)` which would likely lead to lost audit messages.
